# project-euler-programming-challenges

* Motivation: Just because I haven't written anything in a while
* Reference: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
* RoadMap: 
  * I'll run through the tasks  in ruby to start
  * Depending on how quickly I finish and if time permits I'll rewrite the tasks in other Languages for  funzies
